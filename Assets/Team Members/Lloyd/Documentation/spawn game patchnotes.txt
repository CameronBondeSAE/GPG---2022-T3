HOW TO USE LEVEL GENERATOR

-- Num Cubes -- sets number of cubes to spawn, determines map size

-- zoomX, zoomY -- adjusts perlin noise

-- scale -- adjusts map height

-- Walls Height -- adjusts how high the walls that encircle the level are

-- Num Items -- controls how many items prefabs will spawn (needs to reset with each terrain generation)

-- Randomise Values -- randomises zoomX, zoomY and scale

-- Generate Terrain -- creates the level

HQ patchnotes

1.2

-- Human HQ spawns dead center, colours self green
-- Destroys all objects around it

-- figure out more interesting ways to spawn Alien HQ (Distance from Human? use perlin noise?)

-- Alien HQ spawns red

1.3

-- added for loops and lists for spawning items and HQ. Perlin noise now spawns vector 3 transforms, which are stored as a list, which are then looped through to spawn objects at their respective transforms (add to terrain later? also properly figure out list size constrictions and looping until it's done)

-- successfully added logic for a minimum spawn distance between HQs :)

1.4 

-- HQ's now destroy walls on spawn (overlap sphere targets health component)

Fire patchnotes

-- added sphere that increases heat by float value

-- if object is a minimum distance, heat is signficantly increased by the proximity multiplier

-- added ripped DOOM fire sprites. made an animation controller for sprite cycling. fires start, idle, then fade over time
